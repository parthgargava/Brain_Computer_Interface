# Brain_Computer_Interface
This project on Brain Computer Interface system uses neuropotential energy generated by human brain to navigate a simple robot using Support Vector Machine classifier on Bnad power features of Electro-Encephalogram signals.
Below attached are some of the codes and basic functions (without any dataset)
